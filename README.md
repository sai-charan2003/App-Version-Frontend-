# App Version Tracker Frontend

App Version Tracker is a solution for developers who don't publish their apps through the Play Store and need a way to provide updates to users. With the Version Tracker API, you can easily compare your app's local version with the latest version on the server. The service offers a dashboard to manage all your app versions. Simply update the version number in the dashboard, and the new update becomes available to all usersâ€”it's that straightforward.
